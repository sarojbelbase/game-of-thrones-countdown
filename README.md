# Game Of Thrones Countdowner

This is a simple glitch project that countdowns the remaining days for the premiere of first episode of Game of thrones. It simply shows days, hours, minutes & seconds. It is not responsive yet, but will support that in future commits. Actually, I made this in the middle of exam. It runs so-better in desktop version, trust me.
